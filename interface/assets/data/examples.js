      "Sunbathing causes cancer\u00a0\r\n\r\nBy Alex McFadden, Journalist at slate.com\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nAccording to a recent study, there is no safe way to sunbathe. Even small doses of ultraviolet radiation from the sun and tanning beds may cause cancer.\r\n\r\nUltraviolet (UV) radiation is one of the most frequent causes of cancer, but it can be avoided. So says Professor David E. Fisher in an interview with slate.com about his most recent study of the relationship between UV radiation and skin cancer.\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nFisher\u2019s study shows that people who have used a tanning bed before the age of 35 have a 75% higher likelihood of developing skin cancer than those who have not used a tanning bed at such an early age. In fact, the results show that having used a tanning bed even once results in a higher risk of skin cancer.\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nAccording to a study conducted in Norway, \u201ceach year, approximately 250 people die in Norway from skin cancer primarily because of excessive sunbathing. The risk of cancer increases, since many are not sufficiently careful in applying sunscreen and taking breaks in the shade. There are grounds for serious concern when nearly 30% of adolescents report that they are \u201ccompletely certain\u201d that they will be sunburned during their holidays. Having sunburn increases the overall risk of skin cancer.\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nSunbathing is a dangerous source of vitamin D\u00a0\r\n\r\nFisher points out how some researchers recommend the population to sunbathe to obtain sufficient vitamin D, but he warns that such a recommendation has many problems.\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\n\u201cWe are thus in a situation where people are recommended to use something that we know is carcinogenic to obtain a vitamin. There are many far safer ways to obtain this vitamin. If you suspect that you have too little vitamin D, go to your doctor to have a blood sample taken.

From a medical point of view, this is a very simple issue, and we have a clear and unambiguous answer to the question of whether people should sunbathe to obtain enough vitamin D.

      "\r\nGasoline prices are getting higher and higher. Drivers have to pay more to\r\nfill their cars with gas. The prices make it hard for drivers to afford the\r\nfuel. Some drivers are looking for solutions. They want to find a way to\r\nsolve this problem. Car makers are also looking for was to lower gas\r\nprices.\r\n\r\nOne auto group hosted a special event. The event was designed to display\r\nnew kinds of cars. The new cars don't run on gasoline. Their engines are\r\ndifferent. They run on alternative fuels.\r\n\r\nThese new kinds of cars burn many different kinds of fuel. Some of these\r\ncars are called hybrids. Hybrids run on a combination of gasoline and\r\nelectricity. Other cars run on natural gas. Another kind of car runs on a\r\nspecial fuel cell. The cell is filled with a gas called hydrogen. All of\r\nthese cars use less gasoline. That makes them less expensive for people to\r\ndrive.\r\n\r\nThe fuel cell cars are also better in another way. They give off no\r\nemissions. They are very clean, and don't give off bad fumes when they run.\r\nCars that run on gasoline give off harmful fumes. These fumes pollute the\r\nair. Air pollution is very bad for the environment.\r\n\r\nOne man who makes fuel cell cars is excited about hydrogen fuel cell\r\ntechnology. He says we will never run out of the source of the fuel, but we\r\nmay run out of oil. Oil is a fossil fuel, and comes from deep in the\r\nground. Once we use it up, it will take millions of years for more oil to\r\nform. Since gasoline is made from oil, that could be a problem for\r\ncompanies who make traditional cars, and for drivers. However, it won't be\r\na problem for cars that run on fuel cells.\r\n\r\nMany people are happy that they will have an alternative to gasoline cars,\r\nbut they worry about the cost of fuel cell cars. Right now they are very\r\nexpensive. One man says that if he buys a fuel cell car, he will have to\r\ndrive it thousands of miles before he breaks even. Manufacturers say that\r\nfuel cell cars won't be affordable for about ten years.\r\n\r\nThe manufacturer says that fuel cell cars will save drivers money in\r\nanother way. Drivers will have to spend less money on maintenance. There\r\nare no big moving parts in the engine. If something goes wrong, an owner\r\ncan plug a laptop into to check it out. Most repairs will be made by\r\ncomputer programs instead of mechanics.\r\n\r\nBuses that run on hydrogen fuel cell power are being tested on the roads.\r\nThey could become a common form of transportation in the near future.\r\n\r\n",

  Chromosomes: {
    summary:
      "Males have one Y chromosome and one X chromosome, while females have two X chromosomes. In mammals, the Y chromosome contains a gene, SRY, which triggers embryonic development as a male. The Y chromosomes of humans and other mammals also contain other genes needed for normal sperm production.The XY sex-determination system is the sex-determination system found in humans, most other mammals, some insects (Drosophila), some snakes, and some plants (Ginkgo). In this system, the sex of an individual is determined by a pair of sex chromosomes. Females typically have two of the same kind of sex chromosome (XX), and are called the homogametic sex. Males typically have two different kinds of sex chromosomes (XY), and are called the heterogametic sex. Exceptions to this are cases of XX males or XY females, or other syndromes.\r\n",

      "Mode of Inheritance: Sex Determination\r\nRecall that in humans the diploid number of chromosomes is 46, or 23 pairs. There are 22 pairs of matching homologous chromosomes called autosomes. Homologous autosomes look exactly alike. The 23rd pair of chromosomes differs in males and females. These two chromosomes, which determine the sex of an individual, are called sex chromosomes. In humans, the chromosomes that control the inheritance of sex characteristics are indicated by the letters X and Y. If you are a human female, XX, your 23rd pair of chromosomes are homologous and look alike. However, if you are a male, XY, your 23rd pair of chromosomes look different. Males, which have one X and one Y chromosome, produce two kinds of gametes, X and Y, by meiosis. Females have two X chromosomes, so they produce only X gametes. \r\nDrosophila, commonly know as fruit flies, inherit sex chromosomes in the same way as humans do. Traits controlled by genes located on sex chromosomes are called sex-linked traits. The alleles for sex-linked traits are written as superscripts of the X or Y chromosome. Because the X and Y chromosomes are not homologous, the Y chromosome has no corresponding allele to one on the X chromosome and no superscript is used. Also remember that any allele on the X chromosome of a male will not be marked by a corresponding allele on the Y chromosome.\r\nIn 1910, Thomas Hunt Morgan discovered traits linked to sex chromosomes. Morgan noticed one day that one male fly had white eyes rather than the usual red eyes. He crossed the white-eyed male with a homozygous red-eyed female. All of the F1 offspring had red eyes, indicating that the white-eyed trait is recessive. Then Morgan allowed the F1 flies to mate among themselves. According to simple Mendelian inheritance, if the trait were recessive, the offspring in the F2 generation would show a 3:1 ratio of red-eyed to white-eyed flies. That is what Morgan observed. However, he also noticed that the trait of white eyes appeared only in male flies. \r\nMorgan hypothesized that the red-eye allele was dominant and the white-eye allele was recessive. He also reasoned that the gene for eye color was located on the X chromosome and was not present on the Y chromosome. In males however, a single recessive allele is expressed as a white-eyed phenotype. When Morgan crossed a heterozygous red-eyed female with a white-eyed male, half of all the males and half of all the females inherited white eyes. The only explanation of these results is Morgans hypothesis. The allele for eye color is carried on the X chromosome and the Y chromosome has no allele for eye color.\r\nTraits dependent on genes that follow the inheritance pattern of a sex chromosome are called sex-linked traits. Eye color in fruit flies is an example of an X-linked trait. Y-linked traits are passed only from male to male.\r\n",
